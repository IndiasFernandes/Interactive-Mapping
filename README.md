(Web/Geolocation)

![alt text](https://github.com/IndiasFernandes/Interactive-Mapping/blob/main/map_preview.png?raw=true)

An html map built using folium through Python that shows several Eco-Communities in the area of Portugal.

The map is created using a CSV file that can be a more complex database. It also uses the JSON file world.json with the polygon areas from several countries.

All the points, when clicked, open an HTML popup with a link to their website. 

Everything can be changed and adapted.
